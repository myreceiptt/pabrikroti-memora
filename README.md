- Package manager:

  - **Yarn** (lockfile: `yarn.lock`)

## ℹ️ General Information

**PABRIK ROTI: Programmed Bread Factory for Web3 Distribution**  
_Developed and maintained by [Prof. NOTA Inc.](https://nota.endhonesa.com)_

---

### 🏗️ What is PABRIKROTI?

**PABRIKROTI** is a white label, multi-tenant, Web3-enabled application designed to create, display, and distribute tokenized digital assets—referred to as **Programmed Bread**. It supports NFTs (ERC-721/ERC-1155) and fungible tokens (ERC-20), integrating dynamic tenant configurations, visual claim interfaces, and cultural licensing through a fully modular and customizable framework.

PABRIKROTI operates as a **decentralized digital production space**, where each domain/subdomain (e.g., `pabrikroti.endhonesa.com`) loads unique configurations for its respective brand, campaign, or cultural project, while still using the same underlying platform.

---

### ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Tenant-Based Theming**  
  Auto-detects hostname, which is domain/subdomain and applies custom config from `/src/config/receipts/`.

- **NFT Explorer & Claim Interface**  
  Pages like `/free`, `/paid`, `/token/[idNFT]` list and handle claiming of tokenized assets with eligibility logic, fallback visuals, and blockchain status integration.

- **ERC-20 Token Claim Pages**  
  Pages like `/coins`, `/address/[coinAddress]` enable users to claim community or utility tokens with live metadata, eligibility checks, and claim buttons.

- **Flexible Front Page (Multi-Mode)**  
  Depending on the domain/subdomain, the home page renders:

  - **Mode `abc`**: Login gateway with featured tokens
  - **Mode `aiueo`**: Landing page for branding & storytelling

- **Web3-Ready & Mobile Optimized**  
  Built with:

  - Next.js 16 + App Router
  - React 19 + Server Components
  - Tailwind CSS v4
  - ThirdWeb SDK v5
  - Prof. NOTA Inc. Protocol

- **Ethical Licensing & Multilingual Manifestos**  
  Supports 6+ languages for license agreements and project manifestos. Access is granted only with permission from [Prof. NOTA & Prof. NOTA Inc.](https://nota.endhonesa.com/) or certified facilitators.
